# Wren CGI

This is just an experimental fork of the [Wren CLI](http://wren.io/cli) for usage within a _CGI_
environment. This is not meant for production since it just an experiment.
A proper _Wren_ - _CGI_ integration should be done with more robust frameworks like
[KCGI](https://github.com/kristapsdz/kcgi) or [Qdecoder](https://github.com/wolkykim/qdecoder).

For documentation and usage, see http://wren.io/cli
For more information about Wren, the language used by the CLI, see http://wren.io

## Usage

Once built, put the executable inside a _CGI_ enabled webserver like _Apache2_.
Then call your script as usual.

## To build the Wren CGI

### Windows

The `projects/vs20xx` folders contain Visual Studio projects.

### macOS

The `projects/xcode` folder contains an Xcode project.

### Linux

The `projects/make` folder contains a `make` project.
From that folder, run `make`.

`cd projects/make`
`make`

### FreeBSD

The `projects/make.bsd` folder contains a `make` project.
From that folder, run `make`.

`cd projects/make.bsd`
`gmake`

## Alternative build options

The projects are generated by premake, found inside `projects/premake`.
You can use premake5 (alpha 14 was used) to generate other projects.
Generate other system's projects via the premake `--os` flag,
i.e if on linux, `premake vs2019 --os=windows` is valid.
